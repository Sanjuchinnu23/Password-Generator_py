âœ… Project Highlights

Automatically creates strong and unpredictable passwords.
Allows users to control password length.
Uses Pythonâ€™s string and random modules for simplicity and security.
Easily extendable for more complex rules (e.g., no symbols, at least one uppercase, etc.).

âœ¨ Features

Custom Length â€“ Users can enter any password length.
High Complexity â€“ Combines:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Digits (0-9)
Special characters (!@#$%&*...)
Randomness â€“ Uses random.choice() to ensure unpredictability.
Easy to Use â€“ Simple input-output structure.
Secure Defaults â€“ All major character types included.

ðŸ“š What I Learned

How to use Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries:
string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation
The use of random module for generating unpredictable output.
How to combine character sets for higher password strength.
Using list comprehension and string joining for concise code.

ðŸ§  How I Solved It

Identified Requirements â€“ Users should define password length.
Used string module â€“ It provides predefined sets of characters like letters, digits, punctuation.
Used random.choice() â€“ To pick one random character at a time from the full character set.
Repeated the process length times â€“ Using a loop or list comprehension.
Displayed the final password â€“ Using a simple print().
